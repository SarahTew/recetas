        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Recetas de las Américas is a web project from The US Caribbean & Ethnic Florida Digital Newspaper Project using newspapers digitized as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program(NDNP), a federal partnership between the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
        
        <p>The website allows users to view, browse, filter, and print recipes published between 1954 and 1960 in the Miami newspaper, <i>Diario las Américas</i>. Recipes are available in  Spanish (original language) as well as in English translation. Each recipe page brings together the text of the recipe in English or Spanish, an image of the original recipe in the newspaper, the permalink to the page on which it appears in Chronicling America, and a printable PDF recipe card in either English or Spanish. All recipes are browsable and searchable by title as well as filterable by course, ingredients, and dietary restrictions.</p>
        
        <p>All material used to create this website is available on the Recetas project <a href="https://github.com/SarahTew/recetas">Github</a>.</p>

        <h4>Metadata</h4>
        
        <p>The text and metadata of each recipe was collected manually by Melissa Jerome, Latin American & Caribbean Digital Initiatives Librarian at the University of Florida and Sarah Tew, Project Coordinator of the US Caribbean & Ethnic Florida Digital Newspaper Project.

        <h4>Harmful Language Statement</h4>
        
        <p>Historical newspapers reflect the opinions and attitudes of their time. Their pages, including newspaper recipes, can contain biased, offensive, and outdated words and images that are now understood to be harmful.</p>
        <p>This resource presents a recipes from newspapers with names/keywords that may reflect racist and xenophobic opinions and attitudes, or other harmful and derogatory language.</p>
        <p>The US Caribbean & Ethnic Florida Digital Newspaper Project does not censor the original language used in these resources in the interest of historical accuracy, but we strongly condemn racism and discrimination and actively strive to create resources that do not.</p>
